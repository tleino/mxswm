MaXed Stacks Window Manager for X11
===================================

This window manager keeps windows in a number of stacks of same size and
allows quick changing between the windows using keyboard.

This is useful for people who hate micromanaging the position and size
of windows using mouse.

If it is necessary to stack some windows vertically, you can use xvbox.
See https://github.com/tleino/xvbox .

If it is necessary to manually manage position and size of some windows,
run a separate window manager better suited for the job in Xephyr.

This window manager was originally created to be a simpler alternative
for https://github.com/tleino/cocowm by the same author. Reaping the
full benefit of cocowm requires a specialized command shell system.
However, a simple maximizing window manager like mxswm is fine enough
for most purposes when working with programs that were designed for
the full screen view.

At the moment mostly works, but is not flawless. Also, requires manual
customization from mxswm.h for e.g. setting the fonts and borders. There
is some initial support for runtime configuration through a Unix domain
socket using 'mxswmctl' command.

Feature TODO
============

 - Choose window by typing letters of its name (similar to
   reverse-search or ^R in shells).

 - Move between multiple windows without going through the menu,
   i.e. make the existing "cycle to next client" function unlimited.

 - Close windows from menu / close foreground window.

 - Xinerama (multi-screen) support (can be copied from cocowm).

 - Runtime configuration of max stack width (useful for setting sane
   maximums, or for setting the width for 80 column terminals).

 - Temporarily hide other stacks.
